# Project 04 - 2D Platformer

March 27, 2021. 
This is a 2D Platformer game that I created for Project 04.

## Implementation

I used tiles and characters from the Scribble Platformer pack on https://kenney.nl/assets/scribble-platformer and used the yellow diamond from the Puzzle Pack on https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack for my coins. I was going to implement some juicy features, but didn't have the time or the patience to do so.

Some features implemented in this game are enemies (both enemies that patrol certain areas and 1 enemy that chases the player), 2 levels, little coins around each level to be collected, a menu screen, as well as save and load functions.
